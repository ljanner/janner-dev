This project is my personal website, where I want to display my projects, write my own diary and implement any features that sound useful to me. On top of that I want to learn a lot about coding with this project.

This project is by no means perfectly planned out, my goal is to share everything I do in this project (even if it's embarrassing). I will always try my best, but I'm not afraid of failure or being an idiot sometimes `:)` .
