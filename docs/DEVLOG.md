# Devlog

First of all, this isn't really a devlog, I just wanna have a place to write down some thoughts every time I work on the project and this is the best idea I had.

`06.08.2022` I wrote a lot of markdown files and feel very organized but I'm still clueless on how I really start with the code :). First I managed to create a vue app with js instead of ts and now im sitting here wondering what packages I need or don't need. I for sure still need a design framework but im happy with what I've done today :D
