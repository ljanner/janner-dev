# Devlog

First of all, this isn't really a devlog, I just wanna have a place to write down some thoughts every time I work on the project and this is the best idea I had.

---

`06.08.2022` I wrote a lot of markdown files and feel very organized but I'm still clueless on how I really start with the code :). First I managed to create a vue app with js instead of ts and now im sitting here wondering what packages I need or don't need. I for sure still need a design framework but im happy with what I've done today :D

`14.08.2022` I have decided that I'm more interested in a portfolio than all this functional stuff because it requires a bit more preparation work, but for now I just want to do something. I'll look into animations and other stuff too hopefully. As for the design framework I have finally decided on [Naive UI](https://www.naiveui.com/) after some unsuccessful tries with other frameworks. For icons I use [xicons/matierial](https://www.xicons.org/#/).
